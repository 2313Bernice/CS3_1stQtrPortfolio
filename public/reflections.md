# Reflections for 1st Quarter
## By Bernice V. Lorenzo, 9 - Lithium

### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Comparison Operators**: JavaScript's comparison operators are almost the same as what we've learned from C++ last year âœ¨. The only difference now is that there are additional comparison operators compared to the ones we already know. These are ***'===', '==', '!=' and '!=='***, each of which I already know the function of.

2. **Logical Operators**: The logical operators of JavaScript are the same as that of C++. The three logical operators in JavaScript are ***AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!)***. These logical operators are easy to understand, given the exercises and learning guides given to us.

3. **Variable Declaration**: Compared to C++, JavaScript gives me more freedom when it comes to declaring and manipulating variables ðŸ’«. It is easy to understand their functions given that they are more lenient when it comes to varying data types. The variables ***let, var and const*** give me more flexibility when it comes to coding and declaring my variables.

4. **Input and Output**: There are many ways to display an output through JavaScript, varying from displaying something on the page itself or even an alert box that can pop up on the user's screen. There are also ways to get user input and manipulate the values in order to make it usable and accesible to the code. We were able to practice these different methods, most of which I already understand/master ðŸ˜Ž.

5. **Conditional Statements**: Just like C++, JavaScript uses ***If, Else if, and Else statements*** to set conditions that the code must evaluate before doing a specific action or instruction. There are also nested if statements, which allows me to create codes with more specific conditions within a condition. With prior knowledge as well as extra exercises and learning guides, it was easy to understand and master this topic.

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed 

1. **Functions**: It was easy to understand the concept of functions, its structure, and ways to declare and call a function. Yet, it is a bit difficult for me to practically apply it when coding. It depends on the problem given to us, but I sometimes find it difficult to construct functions given that there may be many variables/inputs/operations or if the problem is too complex for me to understand ðŸ¥¹.

2. **For loops**: This type of loop statement is a little easier for me to grasp as it's what I mostly used during last year's C++. It is also easy to understand the structure as well as its concept. My only struggle is practically applying it during coding tasks depending on the task's difficulty. I also find it a little confusing to understand the scope of the loop, especially with variables. Overall, I just need more practice especially in more complex types of coding tasks.

3. **While loops**: I know the basic structure as well as the concept of while loops, I just don't use it as often as I use for loops. Because of this, I have more confusion when it comes to conceptualizing codes that involve the use of while loops. Overall, I need more practice on using while loops as there might be times where this type of loop structure is more appropriate than for loops.

4. **Do-while loops**: I know the concepts of do-while loops, but I have difficulty when it comes to remembering its structure and practically applying it when coding. I barely used do-while loops during C++ last year, and I rarely use it now in JavaScript ðŸ¥¹. While coding exercises usually involve for loops or while loops, there will be cases where do-while loops are more appropriate. Therefore, I really have to familiarize myself with this type of loop statement.

5. **Switch statements**: The topic was relatively easy to understand due to our formal lecture as well as the provided learnings guides. Not to mention, switch statements were also discussed and used in C++ last year. I just need more practice on this topic in order to be more familiarized with its structure and its uses.

###  Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items

1. **Functions**: Do coding exercises that involve the use of functions. There are many websites that have coding exercises that I can try out. I plan to do ones that are more challenging so that I can familiarize myself with the use of functions. I also plan to look back on old practice exercises and lectures so that I can recall information, evaluate my progress, and redo old codes to further improve it based on what I've relearned.

2. **For loops**: Do coding exercises that involve the use of for loops. There are many coding exercises online that specifically recommend the use of for loops. I can also look back on my old C++ codes to get a grasp or at least refresh myself on the use of for loops since it basically has the same structure and concept with that of Javascript. There are also tutorials online that I can watch or read, which allows me to learn concepts that I find confusing.

3. **While loops**: I'll prioritize learning while loops more than for loops since I don't use this type of loop structure often. I'll look for coding exercises online and do them while encouraging myself to use while loops more. There are also learning guides and tutorials that I can watch in order to better familiarize myself with the use of while loops as well as its structure depending on the type of coding exercise.

4. **Do-while loops**: Between the three loop statements, I'll dedicate more time to practicing and familiarizing myself with do-while loops. I'll watch tutorials online as well as read over learning guides or sources where I can familiarize myself with the structure as well as its practical use in codes. After understanding the basics of do-while loops, I will practically apply what I've learned through doing coding exercises that I would find online.

5. **Switch statements**: My main goal is to become more familiarized when it comes to using switch statements so that I don't have to rely so heavily on using if and else statements. I'll find coding exercises online as well as browse through old coding exercises to practice more on applying switch statements. I'll also try to familiarize myself with its structure, specifically how cases are structured based on certain conditions.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

#### Effective activities:

1. **Short Lectures + Coding Exercises**: I find it very effective to have short lectures first, discussing the main concepts of a topic as well as structures of codes or their uses. After lectures, we would have mini activities where we can practically apply the topics into codes that would meet the activity's requirements. This is effective because it allows us to first understand the basics of a topic before applying and actively remembering what we've learned through coding activities.

2. **Kahoot**: Not only is Kahoot very engaging for me and my classmates (who are very competitive with each other hehe), but it is also an effective way to test our understanding on a topic. Since we are still new to a topic, Kahoot's use of multiple choice gives us a more guaranteed chance of getting a question right rather than guessing and praying that we get it right. It is also fast paced and has a ranking system, which encourages us to properly understand a lesson in order to get answers right. Getting on the podium is just a bonus for us âœ¨


#### Not Effective activities:

1. **Speed tests**: Speed tests aren't necessarily bad, it can just be very stressful due to time constraints. Personally, it feels very disorienting to apply a coding lesson so abruptly while being pressured to be finish a code so fast in order to gain bonus points. It is still very effective for when we want to start applying what we've learned, it is just a personal perspective that it can be a little too sudden or pressuring.

2. **Long lectures**: Lectures are fine, but if the entire class period consists of only lectures that are long, it can lead to information-overload or even disoriented understanding. It isn't as effective as short lectures with coding exercises afterwards because it is hard to retain information when there are no stops or if we don't get to apply it later on. Overall, it just feels more engaging and effective if periods don't consist of just pure lectures but a combination of short lectures plus activities such as mini quizzes or coding exercises that lets us recall what we've learned.
