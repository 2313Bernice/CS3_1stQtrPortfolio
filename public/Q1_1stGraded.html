  <p> I am Bernice V. Lorenzo from Gr.9 Lithium. I like music related stuff, certain animes/series/games,
      and diy crafts. Although Computer Science isn't my forte, I am ready to learn a lot this school 
      year! That's why I took summer classes for Computer Science, so I only know the basics of HTML and 
      CSS. I look forward to learning a lot from you po! (If you're reading this po hehe)
  </p>
  <p> P.S: Even though the instructions said to personalize and just put our names, I hope changing
      the background color doesn't deduct anything huhu. Sorry po, the instrusive thoughts won TvT
